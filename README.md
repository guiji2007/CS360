This Android Studio project is an inventory management app that features in CRUD operations on the SQLite database in the Android OS. 
The app has a new user registration function as well as a login page. 
Users can add items with their names, and quantities, and set up the warming quantity for specific items. 
Once the on-hand quantity drops lower than the warming quantity, users can opt to receive SMS message alerts.
