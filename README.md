My app is an inventory management mobile application. The goal is to help the user to manage its inventory. To meet this end, this app offers CRUD operations on an SQL database. Users can able to create, read, update, and delete data entries. Lastly, users can opt to send SMS messages from the app to the number they entered for the alert message of items at a low inventory level.

The UI design of this app is based on my perspective as an app user. First of all, I used consistent colors for the screen background, text views, and buttons. Then, I applied buttons for the user to take actions, such as the CRUD operations. I also design the organization of all screens so that the screen movement is logical to the users. 

I have encountered many challenges in the coding process, from creating SQLite Databases to implementing User permission Checks. With all my resources available, I was able to piece different parts together in this project. I used the object-oriented programming coding practice to implement classes, objects, and methods. In the future, I will spend more time designing the framework or structure of my codes. 

I spent the same amount of time in coding as in debugging. Each function outlined by the instructions is tested right after the coding is down. Therefore, my coding is test-driven. 

From initial planning to finalization, the most challenging section was to design the SQL database and create the relative operations. The database is used to manage accounts and inventories. I was not sure in the beginning whether I should create one database for all functions or just keep them separately. In the end, my app creates two databases, one for account management, and the other one for inventory management. 

The part involving SQL queries is the most successful section in this app, I think. This app deals with many query operations, such as logging users or finding items on specific conditions. My query operations all returned solid results, which made me quite accomplished.
